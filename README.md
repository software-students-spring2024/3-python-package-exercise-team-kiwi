## Concept
We wanted to create a package that allows users to generate different kinds of media. We figured this kind of package could potentially be used to easily populate datasets or to generate lists of certain types of media that are popular right now (assuming we keep our datasets updated). The package comes with four functions that allow users to return different songs, movies, TV shows, and current events. 

## Installation
Sang

## Usage
Once installed and imported, you can call each function to generate a certain kind of media.

For example, you can call the get_song() function to generate a song in a specific genre, with optional specifications for the artist/band names, song title, and release date. All inputs must be strings.

The variable fav_song will now contain a tuple holding a song in the Pop genre by an artist/band with the word "One" in it. An example tuple would look like this:
