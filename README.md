## How to contribute (Virtual environment, install dependencies, and build and test your package)

1). First you will need to set up the python virtual environment. This project uses pipenv. If you do not have it install you will need to do so with the command `python install pipenv`

2). To set up the virtual environment, in the root directory run the command `pipenv shell`, then run `pipenv install`. This will install all of the needed dependences.

3). You can run the package in the __main__.py file in the root directory. You will first need to add your functions into the pyMediaFunction.py file and inport them into the __main__.py file. 

4). To test the functions you will need to first add tests into the test_pyRandomMedia.py file. Then you can run the tests with the command `python3 -m pytest`. This will tell you how many tests pass or fail. 

5). To build the python package you can use the command `python -m build`

6). After you have added your functions and tested them, you can make a pull request from a branch of the repo with the commands `git add .`, then `git commit -m {your message}`, and to pull you use `git push origin main`.
